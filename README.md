## Project Links

- [https://codesandbox.io/s/final-project-halo-api-reese-pgviw0?file=/src/App.js]()

## Project Description

As a kid, one of my favorite games was Halo. In this project, I will create an app that, using an API, will display information about Halo's characters, vehicles, lore and more. 

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP EXAMPLE
- Home page with several sections of my app
- Items rendering data w/ a wireframed design

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE


## API

If you opted to make use of an API then use this section to include info about the API you have chosen and a code snippet of the data that it returns and is required for your project. 

| Halo API |
- I've registered and verified this is the API I'd like to use.
[](https://developer.haloapi.com/)

```
{data: {} }
```

## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router| 
| Home | This will render the home page | 
| Category | This will render a page that allows the user to select between item categories | 
| Item | Each item on the app will be rendered on the item page with title, description and image | 


## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project such as Axios, ReactStrap, D3, etc. 

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description.  Code snippet should not be greater than 10 lines of code. 

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
```
